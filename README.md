Research Question:
"To what extend can job satisfaction be measured and monitored?"

In my research I studied to what extend job satisfaction could be measured and monitored among IT employees within a deployment agency. This research is conducted through a case study of Linden-IT, a dutch deployment agency.

My prototype consists of multiple dimensions:
- the monitoring of job satisfaction through one statement every week,
- the dashboard where these results are presented in,
- and the conversational agent that follows up the statement through a data-driven conversation and eventually presenting it to the account manager through a sentiment analysis.

The above three parts are presented in a Linden-IT application. This application is available for both the IT employee, as well as the account managers.
